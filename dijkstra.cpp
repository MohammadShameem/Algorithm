/*
There are n cities and m flight connections between them. Your task is to determine the length of the shortest route from Syrjälä to every city.
Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flight connections. The cities are numbered 1,2,\dots,n, and city 1 is Syrjälä.
After that, there are m lines describing the flight connections. Each line has three integers a, b and c: a flight begins at city a, ends at city b, and its length is c. Each flight is a one-way flight.
You can assume that it is possible to travel from Syrjälä to all other cities.
Output
Print n integers: the shortest route lengths from Syrjälä to cities 1,2,\dots,n.
Constraints

1 \le n \le 10^5
1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5
1 \le a,b \le n
1 \le c \le 10^9

Example
Input:
3 4
1 2 6
1 3 2
3 2 3
1 3 4

Output:
0 5 2
